* **Database:** `MongoDB` (for memory), Vector Databases
* **LLM Inference:** `GroqCloud`
* **API Framework:** `FastAPI`
* **Containerization:** `Docker`
* **Real-time Communication:** `WebSockets`
* **Monitoring & Evaluation:** Custom monitoring tools, LLMOps pipelines
* **Python Tooling:** `uv`, `ruff`
* **Knowledge Sources:** Wikipedia, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
* **Miscellaneous:** `Opik` (if applicable for your specific use case, otherwise remove or replace)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Docker
* `uv` (recommended for dependency management and running the project)
* Access to `GroqCloud` API key
* Access to `MongoDB` instance (local or cloud-hosted)
* Necessary API keys for knowledge sources (if applicable and not publicly accessible)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/philoagents-engine.git](https://github.com/your-username/philoagents-engine.git)
    cd philoagents-engine
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using `uv`:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `uv` is not preferred, you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and configuration:
    ```env
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING="your_mongodb_connection_string_here"
    # Add other necessary environment variables (e.g., for Opik, etc.)
    ```

4.  **Build and run with Docker (recommended for production-like setup):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will spin up the FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and any other services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

5.  **Run locally (for development):**
    ```bash
    # Start MongoDB (if not using Docker Compose)
    # Run the FastAPI backend
    uv run main.py # or python main.py if you have a main entry point
    ```

## üìà LLMOps & Evaluation

This project emphasizes robust LLMOps practices to ensure agent performance and reliability:

* **Automated Evaluation:** Scripts and frameworks for quantitatively evaluating agent responses against predefined metrics.
* **Prompt Versioning:** Tracking changes to prompts to manage iterative improvements and regressions.
* **Monitoring Dashboards:** (Conceptual/To be implemented) Tools for real-time tracking of agent performance, latency, token usage, and error rates.
* **Dataset Generation:** Tools and scripts for creating new, diverse evaluation datasets to continuously challenge the agents.
